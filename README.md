## How to install

1. ``` npm install ```
2. ``` npm start ```
3. Install Expo-cli globally when prompted, or install manually.
4. Web page should now open up that allows to run on iOS, Android, Web

Run on Android preferably. Can't test on iOS right now. 

Running on Web Browser doesn't work 100% because FlatLists OnEndReached event triggers at wrong times on web.
